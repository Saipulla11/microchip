Simple implementation of the ATmega1284(P) programmable microcontroller using a virtual port (COM3/COM4), simulation of the controller's operation through SimulIDE, and a simple graphical interface in C#. Programming the chip in C using the Microchip Studio program. Won't work if you wan't make a COM3/4 or change it in com0com(https://github.com/paulakg4/com0com)
